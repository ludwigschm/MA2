"""Centralised configuration values for the tabletop application.

This module exposes path helpers that are required across multiple
subsystems.  Keeping them in a dedicated place avoids having to recompute
directory information in different modules and allows the UI layer to share
the same assumptions as the engine layer without duplicating constants.
